## üëã Hello there, i'm Edaz

I have made a bunch of stuff on github, and am working on some more *secret* projects at the moment.

Things that I have made include some discord bots (POTATO, UZX), websites ([personal site](https://edazpotato.github.io/ "click to view my personal website"), various commisions) and other [random stuff](https://edazpotato.github.io/junk/ "click to view some random stuff i've made")

You can check out all the things that I've made [here](https://edazpotato.github.io/portfolio/ "Click to view my project portfolio")

### üì´ Contact me

If you want to get in touch for something, the fastest way to reach me is to DM me on discord (`Edaz#5671`), but you can also email me at [edazpotato@gmail.com](mailto:edazpotato@gmail.com "click to email me")
